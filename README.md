# 📊 College Event Feedback Analysis – Future Interns Task 3

This project was completed as part of my **Data Science & Analytics Internship** at [Future Interns](https://futureinterns.com/).

The goal was to analyze **student feedback ratings** for various teaching aspects and turn them into actionable insights using Python and visualization tools.

---

## ✅ **Project Objectives**
- Clean and prepare feedback data collected via Google Forms / CSV
- Calculate and visualize average satisfaction levels across different aspects
- Explore rating distributions and correlations
- Summarize key insights & recommend improvements
- Present results as a **mini dashboard** in a Jupyter / Colab notebook

---

## 🧰 **Tools & Libraries**
- Google Colab (Python notebook)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

---

## 📊 **Visualizations & Analysis Included**
- Horizontal bar chart of average ratings per question
- Correlation heatmap to explore relationships between aspects
- Histogram showing distribution for a selected question
- Violin plot showing distribution shape across all aspects
- Table of average ratings
- Key metrics section (highest, lowest, and overall average scores)
- Final insights & recommendations

---

## ✏ **Key Findings**
- Students gave consistently high ratings across all teaching aspects, suggesting strong overall satisfaction.
- Slightly lower average score was observed on *Degree of difficulty of assignments* — a potential area for review.
- Recommended including free-text comments in future surveys for deeper sentiment analysis.
